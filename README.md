# lewagon-983-collab
The goal of this repo is to get used to a team workflow in preparation for the projects week. 

## Target skills
* [Github fundamentals](https://youtu.be/HVsySz-h9r4)
* [Agile workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/workflow)
*  Scraping (maybe some regex too)
* Database design and manipulation
* Handling data with pandas

## Main idea
After these weeks at lewagon, i believe it's time to put our new skillset to use in a real world app. This will help us to get ready for projects' weeks, we'll waste less time on coordination and workflow setups if we take the time to master this aspect now. At this point each one of us is capable of coding small functions able to perform targetted tasks individually. The plan is to combine our work so that it builds up into an operational complex feature.

### The app
The app i am suggesting is a web scraper that receives a shopping list as input in csv format. Then it scrapes a supermarket's website (or multiple websites) looking for the products listed and returns the prices. This is the main feature for now, we might think of new ones as we learn more about machine learning
